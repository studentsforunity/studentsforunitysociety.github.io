This is the BASIS Tucson North Students For Unity website. The website serves as an archive for all past events/meetings along with previews of future events and other things. 

This website is currently being ran by me, Therese Bunyi; if you want to contribute to developing the site, please talk to me on discord/instagram/in real life. If you have pictures of events, please message me on discord/instagram.
