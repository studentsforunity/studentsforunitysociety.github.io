    "In freshman year, Ms. Rogers and Dr. Shroff were thinking of starting a minority authority book club the next year. I was very excited to join so you could imagine my sadness when they told me that their schedules were so packed that their club was looking to not be a possibility. After a few after school meetings and emails, I managed to found the club along with my close friend Ibrahim Bah under the condition that we would be the main pionners of the club. After a few posters and announcements, we managed to attract four members to our meeting! It was a shaky start, yet after a few more months and reaching out to people individually, Students for Unity started gaining momentum building up to where it is today". -Christopher Amanat
