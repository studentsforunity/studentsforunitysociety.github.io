        <h2>Region Leader: Daniel and Jennica</h2>
        <body>The China table threw three performances, all played live by musical instruments which highlighted the strong musical appreciation in ancient Chinese culture:
            <p>1. The first piece performed was titled “Butterfly Lovers (梁祝).” John Han performed on the viola, Daniel Wu performed on the violin, and Wenli Xu performed on the keyboard. This piece showcased a traditional Chinese music style with its light tone and melodic song structure.</p>
            <p>2. The second piece was played by Nuoyan Zhang on the pipa (琵琶), entitled “Thunder in the Dry Season (旱天雷).” The pipa is a traditional Chinese instrument made up of fretted notes and played upright. The solo performance enveloped the event hall due to the pipa&#39;s unique sound and beautiful design.</p>
            <p>3. The last piece was titled “Peacocks Flying Southeast (孔雀东南飞).” Rita Cai performed this piece on the guzheng (古筝), which is a traditional instrument originating from the Chinese Qin dynasty (221-206 BC). The resonant board of the instrument as well as the skillfully plucked strings created a striking performance that captivated the Meet Yourself event. Thank you to Rita Cai for coming and performing for this occasion!</p>
            
            The snacks at the China table included Jelly-based snacks, rice crackers, and mini cakes commonly consumed in the mainland country by children.</body>
